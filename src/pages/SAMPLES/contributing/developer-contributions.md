title: How to contribute
description: Open-source contribution model
---

As an open-source project, we rely on our community of developers to exercise autonomy to get things done.  Our guidelines for contribution are common-sense and inclusive.

---

## Be excellent to each other

Use words of empathy and kindness.  Don't be judgemental.

If a practice is in most codes-of-conduct, follow that same practice here.  If you're in doubt, talk together with people and play nicely together.

### Look for their best intention

People have a positive intent.  Look for it.

### Don't break stuff

Use spaces, with indentation stops every 4 characters.  Use prettier.  

Run the tests.

### Keep improving things for each other.

It works when camping, and it works in community.  **Leave things better than the way you found them**.

## Credit where credit is due

### Give credit

Every contributor, developer or otherwise, deserves gratitude and recognition.  Be generous with your appreciation for people and the contributions they make.

### Get credit

Remember to claim cooperative contribution credit, to receive Cardano native tokens that account for your contributions.  We are operating cooperatively, with a profit share available to every project contributor.


## Make it excellent

Dedication to improving the developer experience is one of our core values.  Take this to heart.

### Automate the shit out of it

See something wrong?  Help make sure it can't go wrong again, if you can.  **Eliminate sources of problems and magnify your impact**.

### Be security-conscious

No passwords, private keys or api-tokens in the repo.  

Don't just add features that can work...  **Make sure they can't NOT work**.

### Be responsible when disclosing

Do you think you identified a security issue that can be exploited "in the wild?".  Please be conscientious about addressing the vulnerability in a private channel, seeking a mitigation and/or fix for the problem that people can adopt before the knowledge becomes publicly visible to hackers.  **Openness is beautiful, and guarding our colleagues' safety is even better**.

## Keep the repo clean

Normal developer stuff...

#### Remove dead branches
#### Clean up dead code
#### Capture requirements
#### Add tests

```js
/** @type {import('@tailwindlabs/lorem').ipsum} */
export default {
  lorem: 'ipsum',
  dolor: ['sit', 'amet', 'consectetur'],
  adipiscing: {
    elit: true,
  },
}
```
