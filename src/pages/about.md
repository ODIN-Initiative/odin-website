## Innovating together for impact

ODIN contributors are innovating to create a future where decentralized organizations solve hard challenges in the world more effectively than hierarchical organizations can do.

### Social Governance

Sociocracy is a strongly principles-oriented framework for human collaboration and organizational effectiveness.  ODIN practices Sociocracy with a focus on enabling autonomy.  We are spreading the habits and practices to helping our network's organizations to achieve their potential, as well.

### Themes of Impact

  * Governance by people, not by bureaucracy
  * Teamwork, and technology to support the teamwork
  * Education, knowledge-management and Capacity-building
  * Mentorship and Business fundamentals for organizational health and growth

WIthin our network, we help each other grow to achieve more impact in our areas of shared focus.  As we bring new initiatives onboard to our network, we are dedicated to supporting their success and growth, if their purpose is aligned with our themes of impact.

### Solving problems and enabling autonomy

... using Sociocracy as a framework for continuously working to address the big human challenges around innovation and collaboration.
